# Open Problems

following is a collection of problems, that still need to solved.

## Program related
1.Inserting a new line above the element currently does not work well if the line above is not empty

2. Replacing elements produces badly/non formatted code.

3. Classpath is not used.

## Project related

1. checkstyle is missing
